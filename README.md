This is required to run or to make changes to starL.

3. Download and install github for source control

4. Get the latest version of the code from github.

5. Open Eclipse in the ADT bundle, select a workspace. The workspace serves as a buffer between your development to your version of the StarL. The directory can be anywhere as long as you can retrieve it later.

6. In Eclipse, select File > Import. . . . In the import dialog, under the General category,
select Existing Projects into Workspace. Click Next.

7. Select the folder containing the StarL source code as the root directory. A number of
items will appear in the Projects list. Select starlLib, starlSim, RaceApp, MazeApp, TrafficSignApp, DistributedSearchApp, LightPaintingLib, LightPaintingSim.

Some error will present as now you have not install SDK for Android phones.

8. Add SDK by using the SDK Manager
Choose the appropriate version (API 10, Android2.3.3)
